  In the begining, I want to note that I can not even imagine how it is difficult to understand that TIME is enormously and tremendously important resource.
  I know it can sounds boring and ordinary but not even a majority of people realises how time is meaningful. When I was younger my elder brother 
  ,to whom I am immensely grateful, was always saying that <u>Time and Attention</u> are the most important things in our life. I always let those words pass me by and only now understood the depth of those words.
  I am watching how fast time flies and how there is not enough time to get better. A lot of people nowdays waste their time on playing games or watching TikTok and they don't realise how terrible it is.
  I may sound pompous, but it's only because I think I see the importance of time(but it is so expanded thing 'understaning the importance', my child brain just want to understand) and I am terrified of losing control of my discipline and reverting to wasting it.
  Studying! This is the only one way to stay sane! Consciousness was given to us for <u>effort</u> and <u>hard work</u>.
  <h2>Brain is smart</h2>
  A human being is an almost idyllic creature , it's brain is so well-oiled mechanism that even in our century of scientific breakthroughs humanity  still cannot understand, even by any decent fraction, how it works.
  It is very 'smart' (if it is right to say like that) and when you try to change your mindset and start a new life filled with studying and work it simply tries to stop you and make you throw all these efforts away.
  <h2>You should always follow this rule</h2>
  How quickly all things disappear, in the universe the bodies themselves, but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure or terrify by pain, or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless, and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and dead they are- all this it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe. To observe too who these are whose opinions and voices give reputation; what death is, and the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by the abstractive power of reflection resolves into their parts all the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will then consider it to be nothing else than an operation of nature; and if any one is afraid of an operation of nature, he is a child. This, however, is not only an operation of nature, but it is also a thing which conduces to the purposes of nature. To observe too how man comes near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of man is so disposed.
